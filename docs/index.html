            <h2 class="text-emerald-700 uppercase py-1.5 bg-slate-50">Peru's Colonial History</h2>
            <p>Peru has a rich colonial history that greatly influenced its culture and architecture. During the colonial period, which lasted from the 16th to the 19th century, Peru was under Spanish rule.</p>
            <p><em>Conquistadors</em> such as Francisco Pizarro played a significant role in the colonization of Peru. They conquered the Inca Empire and established the city of Lima as the capital.</p>
            <p>The colonial era brought about a fusion of Spanish and indigenous cultures, resulting in unique art, music, and cuisine. The <strong>Baroque architecture</strong> of churches and cathedrals in cities like Cusco and Arequipa showcases the grandeur of this period.</p>
            <p>Today, visitors can explore numerous colonial landmarks, including the <strong>Plaza de Armas</strong> in Lima and the <strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong> in Cusco.</p>

        <section id="indigenous-rebellions">
            <h2 class="text-emerald-700 uppercase py-1.5 bg-slate-50">Indigenous Rebellions in Peru</h2>
            <p>Peru has a long history of indigenous rebellions, where native populations fought against colonial oppression and later, for their rights and recognition.</p>
            <p>These rebellions were often sparked by the exploitation and mistreatment of indigenous communities, as well as the loss of their lands and cultural heritage.</p>
            <p>One notable rebellion was the <a class="text-orange-950" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BApac_Amaru_Revolutionary_Movement" target="_blank"><strong>Túpac Amaru II Rebellion</strong></a> in the late 18th century. Led by indigenous leader José Gabriel Condorcanqui, also known as Túpac Amaru II, the rebellion aimed to challenge Spanish rule and fight for indigenous rights.</p>
            <p>Another significant rebellion was the <strong>Amazonian Indigenous Uprising</strong> in the 20th century. Indigenous communities in the Amazon rainforest protested against the destruction of their lands and the exploitation of natural resources.</p>
